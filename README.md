A comprehensive Rust client for the SEC EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system.

## Why EdgarKit

EdgarKit is built for high-throughput, production-grade pipelines that need to ingest, search, and process SEC filings reliably and fast. It’s a great fit for:

- High-performance financial data pipelines (ETL and streaming)
- Quantitative and fundamental investment research
- Corporate event tracking and governance analytics
- Compliance monitoring and audit workflows
- Building dashboards and alerting for market-moving filings

Rust shines here: many SEC filings (especially S-1, 10-K, 10-Q) are large and complex. Parsing, validating, and extracting structure from these can be very CPU- and IO-intensive. With Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and async runtime, you can scale to millions of documents with predictable latency and minimal overhead.

Compared to Python tools like `edgartools` or `sec-edgar-downloader`, Rust typically:
- Processes heavy filings dramatically faster (no GIL, native threading)
- Uses far less memory (no large dynamic overhead)
- Offers compile-time guarantees and stronger type safety
- Integrates cleanly into modern distributed systems (containers, services)

If you’ve hit bottlenecks with scripting solutions, EdgarKit lets you keep the developer ergonomics while upgrading performance and reliability.

## Installation

Add EdgarKit to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
edgarkit = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

### Feature Flags

EdgarKit uses feature flags to allow you to compile only what you need:

```toml
[dependencies]
edgarkit = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["search", "filings", "company"] }
```

Available features:
- `search` - Search API functionality (requires `serde_urlencoded`, `futures`)
- `filings` - Filing operations (requires `flate2`, `chrono`)
- `company` - Company information APIs (requires `chrono`)
- `feeds` - RSS/Atom feed support (requires `quick-xml`)
- `index` - Index file operations (requires `flate2`, `chrono`, `regex`)

Default features: `["search", "filings", "company", "feeds", "index"]` (all features enabled)

## Quick Start

```rust
use edgarkit::{Edgar, FilingOperations, FilingOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the client with a proper user agent
    // SEC.gov requires format: "AppName contact@example.com"
    let edgar = Edgar::new("MyApp contact@example.com")?;
    
    // Get recent 10-K filings for Apple (CIK: 320193)
    let options = FilingOptions::new()
        .with_form_type("10-K")
        .with_limit(5);
    
    let filings = edgar.filings("320193", Some(options)).await?;
    
    for filing in filings {
        println!("Filed: {} - {}", filing.filing_date, filing.form);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Filing Types You’ll Use Most

Understanding common forms helps target the right data:

- 8-K: Current reports for material events. Ideal for event tracking (mergers, leadership changes, financing, bankruptcy). See the official guide: https://www.sec.gov/files/form8-k.pdf
- 10-K: Annual report with audited financials, risk factors, MD&A, business overview. Deep, comprehensive view. https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-k.pdf
- 10-Q: Quarterly report with unaudited financials and updates. More frequent pulse than 10-K. https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf

Other frequent forms for governance and ownership:
- 3/4/5: Insider ownership changes
- Schedule 13D/13G: Beneficial ownership disclosures
- Form D: Exempt offerings
- Investment company forms like `NCEN`, `N-PORT`, `N-CSR`

## Tips & Tricks

- `DetailedFiling.items`: Quickly scan 8-K items to identify important events. The official 8-K item reference is here: https://www.sec.gov/files/form8-k.pdf. For example, items like `1.01, 2.03, 5.01` indicate significant agreements, creation of liabilities, or a change in control of registrant (5.01).
- `is_xbrl` vs `is_inline_xbrl`: Indicates whether the filing contains XBRL (machine-readable financials) or Inline XBRL (embedded in HTML). Use XBRL parsers for precise numeric extraction; Inline XBRL often improves context and presentation.
- `primary_document`: Often the main HTML/XML file to parse. If you fetch the text filing, the primary document usually appears first.
- Use feature filters and `FilingOptions` to constrain the workload (form types, limits, offsets). For S-1 workflows, consider including amendments (S-1/A) or disabling them when you need only originals.

## Companion Crates (Recommended)

- `crabrl`: High-performance XBRL parser and validator for financial statements. Parse us-gaap concepts at scale. https://crates.io/crates/crabrl
- `quick-xml`: Fast XML parsing, perfect for lightweight forms (3/4/5, Form D, NCEN, Schedule 13D/13G) and structured feeds. https://crates.io/crates/quick-xml
- `rig.rs`: For complex, narrative-heavy filings (S-1, 10-K, 10-Q), use rig.rs with strong models (DeepSeek 3.2, Claude Haiku 4.5, Qwen Plus) to extract sections, summarize, and classify. https://rig.rs/

## Why Rust (A Short Story)

I originally built a filing pipeline in TypeScript. It worked—until it needed to process heavy S-1 filings at scale. Regex-based parsing slowed to a crawl, memory usage spiked, and throughput collapsed. Rewriting the pipeline in Rust solved the core problems: faster IO, deterministic performance, safe concurrency, and efficient parsing. EdgarKit is the distilled client layer born from that migration.

## Usage Examples

// Examples are provided in the `examples/` directory to keep this README concise.

### Download Filing Content

```rust
use edgarkit::{Edgar, FilingOperations};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let edgar = Edgar::new("MyApp contact@example.com")?;
    
    // Get the latest 10-K for a company
    let content = edgar.get_latest_filing_content("320193", "10-K").await?;
    
    // Save to file or process the content
    println!("Downloaded {} bytes", content.len());
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Access Index Files

```rust
use edgarkit::{Edgar, EdgarDay, IndexOperations, FilingOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let edgar = Edgar::new("MyApp contact@example.com")?;
    
    // Get all filings from a specific day
    let day = EdgarDay::new(2024, 8, 15)?;
    let options = FilingOptions::new().with_form_type("10-K");
    
    let filings = edgar.get_daily_filings(day, Some(options)).await?;
    
    for filing in filings {
        println!("{} - {}", filing.company_name, filing.form_type);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Rate Limiting

EdgarKit automatically handles rate limiting to comply with SEC.gov's fair access policy:

- **Default**: 10 requests per second
- **Configurable**: Adjust via `EdgarConfig`
- **Automatic retry**: Exponential backoff on rate limit errors

```rust
use edgarkit::{Edgar, EdgarConfig, EdgarUrls};
use std::time::Duration;

let config = EdgarConfig {
    user_agent: "MyApp contact@example.com".to_string(),
    rate_limit: 5, // 5 requests per second
    timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),
    base_urls: EdgarUrls::default(),
};

let edgar = Edgar::with_config(config)?;
```

## SEC.gov Compliance

When using EdgarKit, please follow SEC.gov's guidelines:

1. **User Agent Required**: Always provide a descriptive user agent with contact information
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect the 10 requests/second limit (enforced automatically)
3. **Fair Use**: Avoid excessive bulk downloading during peak hours (9 AM - 5 PM ET)
4. **Terms of Service**: Review [SEC.gov's guidelines](https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data)

## Error Handling

EdgarKit provides comprehensive error types:

```rust
use edgarkit::{Edgar, EdgarError, FilingOperations};

match edgar.filings("invalid-cik", None).await {
    Ok(filings) => println!("Found {} filings", filings.len()),
    Err(EdgarError::NotFound) => println!("Company not found"),
    Err(EdgarError::RateLimitExceeded) => println!("Rate limit hit"),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
}
```
